# Generalized-Regression-Models

A brief look into some codes from ST 623 Generalized Regression in R. 
Topics: 
- Binary Regression
- Poisson Regression 
- GLMs for Exponential Families
- Overdispersion
- Quasi Likelihood 
- Ordinal Regression
Maximum likelihood analysis for frequency data; regression-type models for binomial and Poisson data; iterative weighted least squares and maximum likelihood; analysis of deviance and residuals; over-dispersion and quasilikelihood models; log-linear models for multidimensional contingency tables.
