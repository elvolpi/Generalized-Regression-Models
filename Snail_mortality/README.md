We want to look at the relationship between temperature of snail mortality as a binary regression problem. 

In snailcodes.R, we look at two different ways to do binary regression , one column response vs two column response. 

In snailcodes-part2.R, using the two column response we do exploratory plotting, CI for LD50 (the amount of an ingested substance that kills 50 percent of a test sample), Fieller's CI, LRT Test, probit model and c-log-log model. Hand done math is omitted
