We analyze the toxicity of insecticides using logistic regression. 

- First, we explore relationships through plotting. 
- Next, we conduct a hypothesis test on parallelism of log-dose. 
- We explore different covariance matrices. 
- We compare Delta Method, Fieller's method, and c-log-link

Data: Flour beetles Tribolium castaneum were sprayed with one of
the three insecticides in solution at different doses. The number of insects killed after
a six-day period is recorded.
